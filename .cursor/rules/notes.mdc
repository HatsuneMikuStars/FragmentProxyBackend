- Always keep detailed notes in markdown (.md) files during your work.
- Record important research findings, decisions, approaches, and context relevant to tasks.
- Include timestamps (date and time) with each entry.
- Clearly structure notes with headings and subheadings for readability.
- Regularly revisit and reference these notes to maintain comprehensive project understanding and ensure consistent decision-making.
- Use markdown formatting to enhance clarity and visual comprehension.
- Notes should be saved consistently in a dedicated, easy-to-access location within the project (e.g., `.knowledge/notes`).
