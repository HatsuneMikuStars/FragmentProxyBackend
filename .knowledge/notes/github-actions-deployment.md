## [2023-04-02 12:45] GitHub Actions Deployment Workflow Implementation

### Overview
Implemented a CI/CD deployment workflow for FragmentProxyBackend using GitHub Actions. The workflow was modeled after an existing TelegramBot deployment configuration and adapted for this Node.js/TypeScript project.

### Key Components

#### Workflow Trigger
- Configured to trigger on pushes to the `main` branch
- Added concurrency setting to cancel in-progress deployments when new ones are initiated

#### Environment Setup
- Using Ubuntu latest runner
- Node.js 18 with Yarn package manager
- Caching dependencies to speed up builds

#### Deployment Process
1. **Build Phase**:
   - Checkout code with full history
   - Set up Node.js environment
   - Install dependencies using Yarn with frozen lockfile for consistency
   - Build TypeScript code

2. **Deployment Preparation**:
   - Install sshpass for non-interactive SSH authentication
   - Create .env file from GitHub secrets
   - Package required files (dist, package.json, yarn.lock, .env) into a tar archive

3. **Server Setup Script**:
   - Checks and installs required dependencies (Node.js, Yarn)
   - Creates application directory at /opt/fragment-proxy

4. **Deployment Script**:
   - Handles process management (stops existing processes)
   - Extracts application files to server
   - Installs production dependencies
   - Creates systemd service for reliable process management
   - Starts and enables the service
   - Verifies successful deployment

### Security Considerations
- Credentials stored as GitHub secrets:
  - SERVER_SSH_PASSWORD
  - SERVER_HOST
  - SERVER_SSH_PORT (optional, defaults to 22)
  - ENV_FILE_CONTENT (complete .env file content)

### Improvements Over TelegramBot Deployment
1. Uses systemd for process management instead of nohup
2. Creates a proper system service with automatic restart capabilities
3. Includes SSH port configuration option
4. Optimizes for Node.js/TypeScript environment vs Python
5. Uses yarn with frozen lockfile for dependency consistency

### Required GitHub Repository Setup
To use this workflow, repository secrets need to be configured:
- SERVER_SSH_PASSWORD: SSH password for root access
- SERVER_HOST: Hostname/IP of the deployment server
- SERVER_SSH_PORT: (Optional) SSH port if not default 22
- ENV_FILE_CONTENT: Complete content of the .env file with all required variables

### Testing Notes
The workflow has been implemented but requires testing after repository secrets are configured.
